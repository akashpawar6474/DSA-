        this problem involves thought process

        any even no can be divided by 2 into 2 same no
        and two same no can become 0

        any odd no can be represented as 1 + odd no - 1

        (oddNo - 1) will be even no so using above stratergy
        we can make it 0

        at last we will reduce all odd no to 0
        if odd no count is even means we can make them 0
        else we cannt
