        Q.what is function prototype?
        what does it takes as an argument
        
        this question dont have clear explanation
        yeah I didnt able to get we have one defined
        fun to get if version is bad or not
        
        maybe we have to do bs over range of 1 to n
        tc = O(logn)
        sc = constant
        """
        start = 1
        end = n
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if not isBadVersion(mid):
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid
        return start
