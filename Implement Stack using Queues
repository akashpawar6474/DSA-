    This is very easy conceptualization problem
    while doing push
    we can have two approaches
        1.using two queues
            a.pop all ele from q1 to q2
            b.then insert ele to q1
            3.pop all ele from q2 to q1 again
        2.using one queue
            a.insert ele into q
            b.pop all ele and insert again in q except last ele
    In second approach we are saving some space
