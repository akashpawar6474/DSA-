        Ask ourself how can we get largest rectange at currIdx?
        => following is histogram example
            [2,1,5,6,2,3]
          -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
         In above array how we will get largest rectange at index 4 where val is 2
         
        Idea is to find latest Smallest Bar Idx In Left and right
        in this case if is 1 and 6 respectively
        
        so how we will get no of bars(width of rectangle) which has
        all bars either greater than current or equal to current
        
        FORMULA for width of rectangle
            idxOfLatestSmallestBarInRight - idxOfLatestSmallerBarInLeft - 1
            6 - 1 - 1 => 5- 1 => 4
        
        now multiply width with curr height to get largest rectangle for curr idx
        
        we can do it on run but it will take quadratic time
        so we can precompute it this will also take quadratic time

                     for last node by default smallest bar in right doesnt exists so put len of array
