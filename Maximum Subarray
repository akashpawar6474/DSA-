        brute force is using two loops it will take quadratic time
        
        history of this problem:
        Grenandar was solving the problem of finding max rectangular subarray sum
        in 2-d matrix and he proposed O(n ^ 6) solution
        
        Grenandar proposed 1-d problem to get more insights into the problem
        and he derived O(n ^ 2) approach (brute force)
        then some scientist shamos derived O(nlogn) solution using divide and conquer
        algorithm
        so he has given seminar in carneige mellon university about this problem
        which was attended by Jay kadane who has derived O(n) dp+greedy problem
        
        Q.how problem is greedy or dp?
        at every step if running sum gets below 0 then we make it 0
        because greedily rather than continuing -ve sum
        it is better to start fresh againg from next idx
        
        at each position we have two choices either to start from curr idx
        or add curr ele to max subarray sum untill previous idx
        
        Q.what questions should we ask ourselfs?
        1.at each postion what we have to do?
        2.if running sum is less than 0 then what we will do?
        tc = O(n)
        sc = constant
        
        take initial maxSum as -math.inf
        """
        maxSum = -math.inf
        n = len(nums)
        currSum = 0
        for currIdx in range(n):
            currSum += nums[currIdx]
            maxSum = max(currSum,maxSum)
            if currSum < 0:
                currSum = 0
