        brute force is very simple create new list with help of two pointers
        
        better we can do with two pointers itself
        but we have to do it inplace
        
        basically we will have 3 ptrs
        smallPrev,small,large
        for eg in below lists
        1 3 5
        2 4 6
        smallPrev will be None
        small will be 1 and large will be 2
        
        steps as follows
        1.move small ptr untill it is lteq large along with following smallPrev
        2.attch smallPrev to larget
        3.swap small and large ptrs
