# DSA-
solutions to graze over
1. Even Odd tree => simple level order problem with slight modifications
2. All paths from source to end => simple graph backtracking problem which can be solved easliy using recursion template for backtracking
3. Mother vertex in directed graph => good dfs problem idea is to do dfs and remember last finished node as candidate of mother vertex. then do dfs from candidate and see if all other nodes are visited are not.
