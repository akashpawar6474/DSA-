# DSA-
solutions to graze over
1. Even Odd tree => simple level order problem with slight modifications
2. All paths from source to end => simple graph backtracking problem which can be solved easliy using recursion template for backtracking
3. Mother vertex in directed graph => good dfs problem idea is to do dfs and remember last finished node as candidate of mother vertex. then do dfs from candidate and see if all other nodes are visited are not.
4.  Find the peak element => classic BS problem with good observations skills
5.  Find peak element in 2d array => full observation based and involved thought process
6.  Min Deletions to make char freq unique => simple greedy problem invloves map for preprocessing then set for calculating unique frequencies and remaining manipulations
7.  Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes => DAG problem very simple involves IN/OUT degrees with including why? as we can only visit any vertex which has indegree 0 manually
8.  Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters => backtraking solution where we consider all combinations
9.  Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero => Math and observations based problem only task is to find how to fill the array
10. Regions Cut By Slashes => simple problem when we deduce this the number of islands problem just trick is to upscale the grid 3 times so we can easily do a dfsORBfs
11. Jump Game => recursive approach is very simple but time and space consuming Iterative is very efficient but involves thought process and neat observations
12. Jump Game 2 => same logic just extraa calculations to know min jumps
13. Jump Game 3 => bfs problem moving level by level and see if any idx(node) satisfy the condition
14. meeting room => find if person can attend all meetings simple sorting and observation to see if no interval overlap each other
15. meeting room2 => finding min rooms for arranging all the meeting brute force is O(n ^ 2) but using minHeap we can reduce it upto O(nlogn)
