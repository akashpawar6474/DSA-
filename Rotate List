        Brute force is pop each item from list
        then attach it to start of the list
        
        we have to do this k times
        tc = O(n * k)
        sc = constant
        
        Now better approach is 
        count the length and attach last node to head
        for future sake
        
        make k inbound
        
        then find new Head of list and break the link
