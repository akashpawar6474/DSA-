        Idea is very simple 
        have two pointers left and right
        
        left pointer will move untill it has next ele
        gt left pointer
        
        right pointer will move untill it has prev ele
        gt right pointer
        
        at last if both are at same idx then this is
        mountain array

        sc = constant
